The trace from last example (with thrashing) looked like this:

Now, we see that some events are in a different order. The reason are the
new OSSS_KEEP_ENABLED() blocks. Entering them includes a communication with
the reconfigurable object. A tag is attached to it which states: "If this
context gets enabled while the tag is there, you may not disable it again.".
As soon as the OSSS_KEEP_ENABLED() block is left, the tag is removed.

This way context switches are inhibited within this block and some
reconfiguration is avoided. If the programmer decided to do so, all both processes
may well use a common, keep-enabled-tagged context. The context is not
exclusively owned by anyone, it just is not pushed away by a different context.

When you compare the times, keep in mind that "process_xyz(): ..." is a
statement declaring what the process is about to do, when it gets permission.
But "decode(): XYZ decode()" tells you that decoding is happening right now.

You'll find that the second version is obviously faster...
